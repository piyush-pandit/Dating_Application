	<p> <i>Date of proposed outing </i> would be on <i> weekends </i> as both of us would be comfortable for it so this decision i leave on you to select the date and number of days, so click the below column and specicy for the same.</p> <br/>
	<strong>Date :</strong> <input type="Date" name="date"> </br> <br/>
	<strong>No of Days :</strong> <input type="number" name="number" min="1" max="2">
